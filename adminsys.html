            <h3>Project information</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Category</strong>: Administration system project </li>
              <li><strong>Client</strong>: School Project</li>
              <li><strong>Project date</strong>:  November , 2023</li>
              <li><strong>Technology</strong>: VMWare, GPO, PFSense, Zabbix </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                During this project in initiation to the system administration we had to create and manage our computer park by applying GPO on the posts.In addition, we set up a firewall and a Zabbix monitoring system that alerted us (by call and discord message) of the status of our disk and network. In addition, we set up a PfSense firewall and a Zabbix monitoring system that alerted us (by call and discord message) of the status of our disk and network 
            
            <ul>
              <li>multiple workstations. Through the use of GPOs, we applied consistent policies and configurations across the workstations. These policies could include security settings, software installation rules, desktop customization, and other relevant configurations. The GPOs helped streamline the management and maintenance of the computer park, ensuring consistent and secure operation.</li>
              <li>Firewall Implementation (PfSense): To enhance network security, we deployed a PfSense firewall. PfSense is an open-source firewall solution that offers advanced features such as traffic filtering, network address translation (NAT), and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities. The firewall helped protect the network infrastructure from unauthorized access and potential threats.</li>
              <li>System Monitoring (Zabbix): We implemented a Zabbix monitoring system to monitor the status and performance of our computer park. Zabbix allowed us to track various metrics, including disk usage and network performance. The monitoring system continuously collected data and generated alerts when predefined thresholds or conditions were met. Alerts were delivered through phone calls and Discord messages, enabling timely response and proactive management of potential issues.</li>
              <li>Alerting and Notification System: The Zabbix monitoring system was configured to send alerts via phone calls and Discord messages. Phone calls served as immediate notifications for critical events or emergencies, ensuring prompt attention. Discord messages provided additional flexibility and convenience for monitoring and communication purposes. The alerting system helped us stay informed about any abnormal disk or network conditions, enabling us to take necessary actions promptly</li>
            
            </ul>

            Throughout the project, we emphasized the importance of managing the computer park efficiently and ensuring the security and stability of the network infrastructure. The implementation of GPOs facilitated centralized management and consistent configurations across the workstations. The PfSense firewall enhanced network security, while the Zabbix monitoring system provided real-time insights into the performance of the system components.
