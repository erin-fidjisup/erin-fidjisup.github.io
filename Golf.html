            <p>
                Creation of a news announcement interface on the client's application using ReactJS and Mantine. The frontend was in ReactJs with a backend in C#/.NET. The mission was to create the backoffice to manage the news on the main application. 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Frontend Development (ReactJS): We utilized ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to develop the frontend of the news announcement interface. ReactJS provides a component-based architecture, allowing for the modular and reusable development of UI elements. The frontend interface provided a smooth and intuitive user experience, enabling the client to easily manage news articles.</li>
              <li>Styling and UI Components (Mantine): To enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the frontend interface, we integrated the Mantine UI library. Mantine provides a set of customizable and modern UI components that facilitated the development of a consistent and visually appealing user interface. These components included buttons, forms, modals, and various other elements, ensuring a polished and cohesive design for the news announcement interface.</li>
              <li>Backend Development (C#/.NET): The backend of the application was developed using C# programming language and the .NET framework. C#/.NET provided a robust and scalable environment for building the server-side logic and handling data management operations. The backend was responsible for handling requests from the frontend, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the news articles, and managing the database interactions.</li>
              <li>Database Management: As part of the backend development, we implemented a database to store and manage the news articles. The choice of database technology may vary based on project requirements, but common options include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. The database was designed to store relevant information about each news article, such as title, content, publication date, and other metadata.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout the project, we focused on delivering an efficient and user-friendly news announcement interface. The frontend interface allowed authorized users to create, edit, and delete news articles, while the backend ensured secure data management and smooth communication between the frontend and the database.

              By leveraging the power of ReactJS and Mantine for the frontend development and C#/.NET for the backend, we successfully built a functional and visually appealing backoffice for managing news articles. The project showcased our ability to work with modern frontend frameworks, develop intuitive user interfaces, and seamlessly integrate with backend technologies to deliver a comprehensive solution.
              
              Overall, the news announcement interface we created using ReactJS, Mantine, and C#/.NET enabled the client to efficiently manage news articles on their application, ensuring effective communication with their users and visitors.</p>
