                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                  The modern travel planning process is broken. Travelers spend an average of <strong>16 hours</strong> organizing a single trip, and <strong>25% give up</strong> because of the complexity. Existing tools are fragmented, forcing users to switch between dozens of websites for flights, hotels, and activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our goal with Kinoko Travel was to solve this problem by creating a single, intelligent, all-in-one platform to make trip planning simple and enjoyable.
                </p>

                <h3>My Role and Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                  As a co-founder, my role was comprehensive, covering both business strategy and technical product definition. This project was developed as part of our application to **Pépite ETENA**, a national program that supports student entrepreneurs in France.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My key responsibilities included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Product Vision & UX/UI Design:</strong> I defined the core concept of an AI-powered trip planner. I designed the user journey, from initial idea to a fully booked and flexible itinerary, and created the initial product mockups.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Market Research & Business Strategy:</strong> I conducted in-depth market analysis to identify key user needs (like the demand for customized and eco-friendly travel). I also performed a competitive analysis to position Kinoko uniquely in the market.
                  </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong>Business & Financial Planning:</strong> I co-authored the entire business plan, including the marketing strategy, go-to-market plan, revenue model (commissions, subscriptions), and created the 3-year financial forecasts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Pitching & Communication:</strong> I prepared and delivered project pitches to juries and mentors, including our successful application to the Pépite ETENA program.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Skills Developed and Outcomes</h3>
                <p>
                  This entrepreneurial project allowed me to develop a wide range of valuable skills beyond traditional development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Business Acumen:</strong> I learned to build a complete business case from the ground up, including market sizing, financial modeling, and defining a legal structure (SAS).</li>
                  <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> I developed a multi-phase deployment roadmap, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and scaling up to a full-featured platform.</li>
                  <li><strong>Product Management:</strong> I translated user needs and business goals into clear product features and technical requirements.</li>
                  <li><strong>Team Collaboration & Leadership:</strong> Working as a co-founder required strong communication, shared decision-making, and the ability to align on a common vision.</li>
                  <li><strong>Technical Design:</strong> I conceptualized the architecture for a complex application involving AI, multiple API integrations, and a real-time user interface.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>
                  The result is a solid, well-researched business plan that earned us a spot in the **Pépite ETENA** program, providing us with mentorship, resources, and a network to turn Kinoko Travel into a reality.
