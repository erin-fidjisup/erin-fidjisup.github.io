                I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at KMUTNB under the supervision of Assoc.Prof.Dr.Thana Chotcuangchutchaval. My main project focused on "Developing AI-based Predictive Models for Biogas System Optimization" for the innovative ST-500 wastewater treatment system.
                The ST-500 is an innovative wastewater treatment system that uses Photosynthetic Bacteria (PSB) to clean water sustainably. It's designed to treat wastewater from households and small communities, making it an ideal solution in areas with limited resources.
                
            <ul>
                <li> Developed machine learning models to predict nitrogen production in biogas systems </li>
                <li> Implemented data preprocessing and analysis techniques using Python and scikit-learn  </li>
                <li> Created a user-friendly dashboard application using NodeJS, ReactJS, and MongoDB </li>
                <li> Presented research findings at the 24th National Innovation Awards Competition in Thailand </li>
            
            </ul>
            The key of this project was to predicting biogas production is crucial to optimizing wastewater treatment systems. By using machine learning, we can forecast how much biogas the system will produce based on various factors like temperature, pressure, and bacterial activity. This helps operators make better decisions and improve the system's efficiency. We usedlinear regression and machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that could accurately estimate biogas production in the ST-500 system. The models were trained on historical data collected from the system and validated using cross-validation techniques. The results showed that our models could predict biogas production with high accuracy, making them valuable tools for system optimization. More than that, we wanted to have an user-friendly application for the operators to monitor the system in real-time. We developed a web-based dashboard that displayed key performance metrics and alerts for the ST-500 system. The dashboard was built using NodeJS, ReactJS, and MongoDB, allowing operators to access it from any device with an internet connection.
